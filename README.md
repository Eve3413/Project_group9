## Introduction:

In this project, we have done two separate analyses on the "311_Service_Requests_2020.csv" dataset, which is published by New York City government tracking all the calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services. With curiosity about the neighbourhood we are living in, we mainly paid our attention to calls related to zip 10025. In the first part, with the interest to investigate what incidents concerned people living nearby most last year, we listed the top 10 types of incidents around complained by people. And as illegal parking has been a large concern for people living in neighbourhoods and with the interest to figure out whether it is a large problem in our neighbouthood, in the second part, we compared the illegal parking complaint rate in our neighbour with the general illegal parking complaint rate in New York City. 

This repository contains three files: A Readme file to describe our work, a Top10.ipynb with our analysis of top 10 incident types and a Parking.ipynb with our analysis of parking incidents






grouped the dataset by zip code to only concentrate on zip 10025 and then analyzed on the top 10
